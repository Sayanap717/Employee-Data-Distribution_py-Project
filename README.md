# Employee-Data-Distribution_py-Project
This project aims to analyze employee data from ABC Company, which consists of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a detailed report on employee data across various teams, and the goal is to clean and analyze the data, present insights, and create visualizations. This repository contains the dataset, code for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of the data, as well as the final report.
# Dataset
The dataset contains information about employees in different teams within the company. The columns include, but may not be limited to, employee ID, team, role, salary, and height. The dataset has 458 rows and 9 columns, and it requires some preprocessing due to data inconsistencies.
### 1. Preprocessing
- **Height Column Fix**: The height column in the dataset contains erroneous data, which will be corrected by replacing the invalid values with random numbers between 150 and 180.
- **Data Consistency**: Any other issues related to data inconsistencies, such as missing or malformed data, will be addressed to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis
- After preprocessing, we will analyze the dataset to extract key insights about employee distribution across teams, roles, and other attributes.
- Statistical summaries, correlations, and patterns will be examined.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Graphical representations will be created to better understand the data and make the findings more accessible.
- Visualizations may include:
  - Distribution of employees across teams
  - Height distribution across teams
  - Salary analysis
  - Other relevant insights

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
